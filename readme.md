I'm a **software engineer** and **problem solver**, currently working with innovative startups and large enterprise products across various industries, including hospitality, marketplaces, healthcare, airline loyalty programs, credit recovery, mining, and consulting.

I **love building products** and learning in public. Iâ€™m a **big open-source enthusiast**, always looking for ways to integrate it into my projects.

Got ideas about startups, technology, or products? Feel free to send me an email or visit my website.
